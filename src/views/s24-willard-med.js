                  Med Club helps Rivers students find their footing in an area

                      For over five years, the Rivers MED Club has led the
                      charge to connect Rivers students with the global hub of
                      science and medicine that is only a few towns away in
                      Boston. This year in MED Club, our members have met with
                      professionals working in areas across the medical field,
                      including students, physicians, and researchers working in
                      spaces from the lab to the operating room. The club’s
                      mission is to provide Rivers students who are interested
                      in medicine with exposure to the field through
                      presentations, workshops, and discussions, especially
                      students who may not otherwise have such opportunities. So
                      far, our members have learned to suture, helped organize
                      our biannual blood drive, received certification in CPR,
                      and provided insight into the medical professionals they
                      want to see over the course of the year.

                      The MED Club 2024-2025 calendar of events kicked off with
                      a discussion with Dr. Albert Kim, a Rivers parent and
                      physician-scientist who was invited back to Rivers after a
                      successful visit with the McCartney Mathematics Scholars
                      last spring. Specializing in cardiac electrophysiology by
                      trade, Dr. Kim began his talk by discussing his decision
                      to pursue science and medicine together by earning an MD
                      as well a PhD in physiology through the Medical Scientist
                      Training Program at the University of California, Los
                      Angeles. Once he began practicing, Dr. Kim was able to
                      treat patients with conditions interfering with the
                      heart’s electrical system while also overseeing clinical
                      research and drug development for these same conditions at
                      Novartis, a pharmaceutical corporation. By the beginning
                      of the pandemic, Dr. Kim had switched to research full
                      time and worked as the Vice President of Clinical Research
                      in the Internal Medicine Research Unit of Pfizer. Students
                      were interested in how Dr. Kim coordinated incredibly
                      high-profile projects as the company investigated
                      treatments and vaccinations for COVID-19. Since 2021, Dr.
                      Kim has served as the Chief Medical Officer at
                      Cambridge-based medical technology company Cytel, where he
                      has worked on award-winning software to maximize the
                      efficiency of clinical trials. During the visit, MED-Club
                      members got valuable insight from Dr. Kim about how to
                      balance a love for science with an interest in clinical
                      medicine.

                      Most recently, the club met with Dr. Christopher Gabel, a
                      neuroscience researcher and lecturer at Boston University
                      Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. Dr. Gabel
                      works with C. elegans, a species of worm, about 1
                      millimeter in length, that is often used in the
                      development of drugs before testing on mice and eventually
                      humans. He explained to Rivers students how, despite their
                      size, C. elegans share a surprising amount of genetic
                      material with humans, and their short lifespans allow for
                      convenient observation in his lab. Rivers students worked
                      to interpret various charts of light and electrical
                      activity that Dr. Gabel uses to monitor behavior of C.
                      elegans neurons in response to stimuli such as anesthesia
                      and synapses, electrical impulses that pass through
                      neurons to trigger an action in the body dictated by the
                      brain. At the end of the presentation, Dr. Gabel mentioned
                      how surprised he was to see that so many students enjoyed
                      not only his work’s practical applications in a doctor’s
                      office or operating room, but the process of running a lab
                      and publishing research as well.

                      Other speakers in MED Club this year have included Dr.
                      Patricia Barrios, a Rivers Spanish teacher and
                      Opthamologist from Bogotá, Colombia who discussed how she
                      became interested in eye surgery after working in a
                      military clinic serving indigenous peoples in the Amazon
                      rainforest, as well as Dr. Derek Stenquist ‘06, an
                      orthopedic trauma surgeon who discussed the connections
                      between orthopedic surgery and the carpentry that he grew
                      up learning from his dad. Many students also recognized a
                      familiar face when they met with Dylan Keusch ‘19, a
                      premedical student at Cornell who decided to work as an
                      EMT on Martha’s Vineyard and pursue research and advising
                      in the neurosurgery department at Boston Children’s
                      Hospital after receiving treatment for a traumatic brain
                      injury.

                      However, members of Rivers MED Club are not only meeting
                      medical professionals through classroom discussions. In
                      the fall, the club hosted pediatrician Dr. David Chung to
                      host a hands-on suturing workshop. With suture kits in
                      hand, students first practiced threading string through
                      cardboard cutouts of fun characters before moving onto
                      professional-quality skin pads. Even working with
                      cardboard cutouts, many found that the relaxed, excited
                      faces of the characters contrasted with the difficulty of
                      the task! We continued our interactive programming with an
                      on campus CPR certification, where paramedic Jarrod
                      MacKenzie administered the in-person portion of the course
                      with training dummies and practice defibrillators that he
                      set up in Revers. Finally, in assemblies or on the lunch
                      line, you may have seen MED Club members helping out with
                      our blood drive, whether it be running the sign up table
                      or brandishing impressive jars of candy when selecting the
                      winning ticket for the raffle that all donors may enter.
