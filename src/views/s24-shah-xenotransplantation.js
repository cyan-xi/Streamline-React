                      There is a worldwide shortage of donated human organs for
                      transplant. About seventeen people die waiting on
                      transplant lists every day. In this human organ shortage,
                      people have developed new medical advances to address this
                      issue, one being xenotransplantation. This is a promising
                      new treatment that entails the transplantation of an organ
                      from a nonhuman animal into a human. This treatment could
                      significantly increase the number of organs for
                      transplant, leading to less life-threatening waiting, cost
                      for care, and exposure to further disease from
                      immunocompromised states.

                      Xenotransplantation has been performed with a 57-year-old
                      patient, David Bennett, with life-threatening heart
                      disease. This was the first successful transplant of a
                      pig&apos;s heart into a human. To make this transplant a
                      success the pig heart had ten genetic modifications. Newer
                      technologies such as gene editing and cloning have allowed
                      altered pig organs to be less likely rejected in the human
                      body. However, slight genetic variations in pigs can be
                      detrimental to humans, making xenotransplants dangerous.
                      The patient died two months after the transplant knowing
                      death was a likely outcome, but this treatment is still an
                      exciting, viable new possibility.

                    In addition to this, on March 16th 2024, the world’s first
                    genetically edited pig kidney was transplanted into a 62
                    year old man, Richard Slayman, with end stage kidney disease
                    at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The kidney had 69
                    genetic modifications and was edited using CRISPR-Cas9
                    technology to remove dangerous pig genes and add specific
                    human genes to make it more compatible to the recipient.
                    Additionally, scientists eliminated porcine endogenous
                    retroviruses in the pig donor to remove the risk of
                    infection in humans. Slayman saw this treatment as a way “to
                    provide hope for the thousands of people who need a
                    transplant to survive.” This treatment was offered under
                    compassionate use protocol by the FDA, and if it is a
                    success will greatly increase how fast xenotransplantation
                    can become a widely offered option.

                    Other approaches being used to meet the never-ending need
                    for organ transplants include organoids and presumed
                    consent. Organoids are small three-dimensional tissue
                    cultures that are grown from stem cells. They can be
                    manipulated to copy the complexity of an organ or to express
                    parts of it such as producing only certain types of cells.
                    Eventually, continued developments in this field might
                    facilitate the end of the organ shortage. They also provide
                    insight into human development and disease and allow
                    scientists to see how medicines interact with organoids to
                    open new approaches to personalized medicine.

                    A few governments have attempted to address the shortage of
                    organs donated for transplant by legislation that presumes
                    consent to the use of a patient’s organ for transplant. It
                    is an “opt out” system rather than explicitly choosing to
                    donate by “opting in.” Presumed consent means that unless
                    the deceased has expressed that they do not want to be an
                    organ donor then consent will be assumed. Several countries
                    such as Spain, Sweden, Portugal, and Austria have legalized
                    presumed consent.

                      Xenotransplantation is any treatment that entails the
                      transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human
                      recipient of either live cells, tissues, or organs from a
                      nonhuman animal source. For example, pig-to-human
                      xenotransplantation requires breeding genetically specific
                      pigs, raising them in controlled conditions, and killing
                      them to harvest their organs. Experiments led to the use
                      of specifically pig organs, as pigs offer advantages over
                      primates for transplants because they are easier to raise
                      and become adult human size in merely six months.

                      The American Medical Association has specific guidelines
                      for physicians and researchers when it comes to this
                      treatment. The AMA states that such professionals have an
                      obligation to contribute to efforts to increase the supply
                      of organs available for transplantation, but they must
                      protect the interests of patients and the welfare of the
                      public. The doctors and researchers need to follow certain
                      guidelines to protect the patients and make sure they
                      understand the nature of this experimental treatment.
                      Requirements include, encouraging education and public
                      discussion of xenotransplantation because of the unique
                      risks, ensuring that research is well funded to ensure
                      lifelong surveillance of xenotransplant recipients, that
                      recruitment is selective to patients with serious or
                      life-threatening conditions, and if there is participation
                      by individuals who lack decision-making capacity,
                      important measures are taken to protect their interests.
