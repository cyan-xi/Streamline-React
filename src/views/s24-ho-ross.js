                      A 2018 survey found that 40% of American people do not
                      believe American Indians still exist. This shocking
                      statistic reveals Americans’ internally racist belief that
                      American Indians are primitive and cannot adapt to modern
                      society. In reality, American Indians not only thrive in
                      present-day society, but are also capable of molding the
                      technological future. Few people would guess that the
                      ability to travel from Earth to Mars was made possible by
                      an American Indian. In fact, Mary Golda Ross, an
                      Indigenous trailblazer in the scientific community,
                      credited her strong mathematical achievements to her
                      Native heritage and community.

                      Born in 1908, Ross grew up in Park Hill, Oklahoma
                      alongside her grandparents. She attended school in an
                      environment where American Indian teachers were just as
                      common as white teachers. Although she was the only girl
                      in her math class, this fact did not deter her from
                      pursuing math as a career. She firmly believed that in
                      such a technical world, “a math background [would] let
                      [someone] go farther and faster.” In 1928, she graduated
                      with a degree in math and went on to become a math teacher
                      for ten years.

                    While she enjoyed teaching, Ross did not want to remain a
                    teacher for the rest of her life. However, because she was a
                    woman, most jobs in the mathematical field were not
                    available to her. Faced with this injustice, she set her
                    sights on a different occupation. She used her time off in
                    the summer to complete coursework at the Colorado State
                    Teacher’s College. Ross’ busy schedule continued for six
                    years until she finally earned a master’s degree in math in
                    1938.

                    As she wrapped up her studies, World War II suddenly hit
                    Europe. When the United States began collecting men for the
                    draft, many jobs opened up for women. Seizing the
                    opportunity, Ross grabbed a job at the Lockheed Aircraft
                    Corporation as a math assistant. Here, Ross’s team worked to
                    improve the design of the PS-38 Lightning fighter plane, a
                    plane which could fly nearly 400 miles per hour. Through
                    various experiments, Ross analyzed data and prepared
                    calculations using a slide rule (they didn’t even have
                    calculators). Ross worked so effectively that when World War
                    II ended and women started being laid off to make space for
                    the returning men, Lockheed opted to keep her. Furthermore,
                    Lockheed sent Ross to complete advanced coursework at the
                    UCLA Extension school, where she became the first known
                    American Indian female professional engineer in 1949.

                    With anti-Communist sentiment rising in America, Ross moved
                    on to work at the Lockheed Space and Missiles Company, which
                    studied submarine technology and other Cold War vehicles.
                    She became part of a special operation titled “Skunk Works.”
                    Out of the forty people who participated, she was the only
                    woman and the only American Indian. Once again, she was a
                    minority. Never deterred, Ross contributed to NASA’s
                    Interplanetary Flight Handbook, Vol. 3, published in 1963.
                    This book advanced the scientific cause by detailing flight
                    paths from Earth to other planets, like Venus and Mars.

                      In 1973, Ross retired from Lockheed. Acknowledging the
                      lack of women in STEM fields, Ross joined the Society of
                      Women Engineers (SWE), in which she helped give advice to
                      aspiring female students. Additionally, Ross began to
                      participate in organizations to uplift American Indians,
                      like the American Indian Science and Engineering society.
                      In her later life, she actively encouraged the
                      preservation of American Indian culture and histories
                      through the creation of the Smithsonian’s National Museum
                      of the American Indian. Although she specifically worked
                      to uplift women and American Indians in STEM, Ross is a
                      role model for all who are fighting to advance the cause
                      of justice.
