                      contributed to an increased mortality rate by impeding
                      access to education, proper healthcare, and proper food.
                      These minority neighborhoods would also be exposed to

                      Folate is a vitamin that breaks down in your bloodstream
                      and helps control your homocysteine levels. Homocysteine
                      controls the contractile strength of your blood vessels.
                      By consuming more folate your homocysteine levels lower
                      which means that your blood vessels relax and decrease the
                      risk of high blood pressure.

                    Aging has a detrimental effect on the heart and arterial
                    system, leading to an increase in a variety of
                    cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, hypertension,
                    myocardial infarction, and stroke). Aging of the blood
                    vessels results in increased arterial thickening and
                    stiffness and dysfunctional endothelium (walls of the
                    arteries). These changes result in increased systolic
                    pressure (pressure during the contraction of the heart) and
                    present major risk factors for the development of
                    cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis,

                    However, some of these vitamins B12, B9, and B6 are
                    protective factors in cardiovascular health. Among the
                    elderly, vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in about 20% of the
                    population; more than 60% are due to food-cobalamin
                    malabsorption syndrome. Increased plasma homocysteine levels
                    due to a lack of folate levels in the bloodstream have been
                    recognized as an important risk factor for CVD. Studies
                    demonstrated that a supplement consisting of 5 mg folic acid
                    and 250 μg vitamin B12 lowered fasting plasma homocysteine
                    levels by 32% after 12 weeks in patients with coronary
                    artery disease. Few studies have been conducted that connect
                    protective factors of B12 and B9 to cardiovascular disease
                    in the NHANES data set. Connections between vitamin usage
                    and ethnicities or socioeconomic status and other
                    demographic factors have been minimally studied. The purpose
                    of this study is to connect vitamin usage to cardiovascular
                    disease and how socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or other
                    demographic factors come into play.

                      This study aims to explore red blood cell (RBC) folate
                      levels as an indicator of cardiovascular disease in
                      multiple demographics of people. Data from the prospective
                      cohort study of the National Health and Nutrition
                      Examination Survey (2017-2020) was analyzed. The
                      association of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk with RBC
                      folate was estimated using logistic regression, adjusting
                      for multiple variables such as age, race, sex, poverty
                      income ratio, smoking status, BMI, and access to health
                      insurance. A total of 3271 patients with RBC folate data
                      that fit the data parameters were included. There was a
                      significant trend between increased RBC folate levels and
                      decreased risk of CHD disease (p &lt;0.035). Compared with
                      the lowest quartile of RBC folate, the
                      multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence
                      intervals for CHD were 0.68 (95% CI 0.28 - 1.67) for the
                      second quartile, 0.47 (0.16 – 1.37) for the third
                      quartile, and 0.27 (95% CI 0.09 - 0.85) for the highest
                      (fourth) quartile. In conclusion, higher levels of RBC
                      folate are associated with a decreased risk of CHD in this
                      cohort.
