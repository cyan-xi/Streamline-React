                      This paper explores ethical questions raised by the issue
                      of patient non-adherence in the homeless population. The
                      homeless population includes those who are chronically
                      homeless, experiencing temporary housing loss, escaping
                      domestic abuse, or confronting various challenges. In
                      2022, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
                      (HUD) counted around 582,000 Americans experiencing
                      homelessness. That is about 18 per 10,000 people in the
                      US.

                      Between 2020 and 2022, there was a 16% increase among
                      individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Chronic
                      homelessness is used to describe people who have
                      experienced homelessness for at least a year—or
                      repeatedly—while struggling with a disabling condition
                      such as a serious mental illness, substance use disorder,
                      or physical disability.

                      Homelessness is strongly linked to deteriorating physical
                      and mental health. In March 2024, the measure known as
                      Proposition 1, which includes $6.38 billion for treatment
                      and housing of homeless individuals with severe mental
                      illnesses and addiction, was passed by voters in
                      California. Despite a narrow 50.2% approval rate, this
                      significant proposition underscores California’s
                      acknowledgment of the pivotal role mental health care
                      plays in addressing homelessness.

                      Moreover, the 2022 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report
                      (AHAR) to Congress and the Continuum of Care Homeless
                      Populations and Subpopulations Report states that 21% of
                      individuals experiencing homelessness reported having a
                      serious mental illness, and 16% reported having a
                      substance use disorder. Recently, in 2023, a wide-ranging
                      study released by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing
                      Initiative at University of California, San Francisco,
                      found that about two-thirds of the homeless people
                      interviewed had serious symptoms of mental illness, yet
                      only about 18 percent had recently been treated. These
                      health challenges arise from multiple factors, including
                      inadequate access to food and shelter and limited
                      availability of resources and social services. In
                      addition, distrust of the healthcare system and past
                      experiences of discrimination from providers can deter
                      unhoused individuals from seeking treatment.

                      A 2022 study highlights the contrast in healthcare
                      coverage between the general population and the homeless
                      community. While 92.1% of people, or 304.0 million, had
                      health insurance at some point during the year in the
                      United States, only about 40% of homeless individuals were
                      insured under Medicare and Medicaid. Shockingly, the
                      remaining 60% lack any form of insurance, despite many
                      being eligible due to their age or disability status.,
                      Health insurance allows access to free preventative
                      healthcare services and mitigates the financial burden of
                      healthcare expenses, both of which are crucial for
                      unhoused and housed individuals.

                    Moreover, in a retrospective analysis based on data from 615
                    homeless individuals, of whom 176 died in the analyzed
                    period of 2010-2016, the average lifespan of a homeless
                    individual was reduced by approximately 17.5 years compared
                    to the general population. This stark disparity underscores
                    the gravity of the health challenges faced by those without
                    stable housing. Furthermore, homeless males have an average
                    age at death of 56 years, while homeless females have an
                    average age at death of just 52 years. Most deaths occurred
                    in conditions of cold stress, particularly from hypothermia.
                    Deaths from hypothermia occurred thirteen times more
                    frequently among the homeless population compared to the
                    general population.

                    In addition, Black Americans have the highest rate of
                    homelessness among the nation’s racial and ethnic groups. In
                    2018, 54 out of every 10,000 Black people in the United
                    States were homeless. In New York, 208 out of every 10,000
                    Black people were homeless and Massachusetts is number one
                    in the country in its rate of Hispanic/Latinx homelessness,
                    with 107 per 10,000 unhoused. With these marginalized
                    communities simultaneously facing disparities in wealth,
                    education, employment, and higher rates of incarceration,
                    the effects of homelessness will further exacerbate existing

                    The homeless population must navigate a multitude of
                    challenges such as managing their physical and mental
                    health, acquiring health insurance, avoiding death by the
                    elements, and facing systemic racism. Homeless individuals,
                    many who are victims of an unjust and unethical system, are
                    worthy of justice and compassion, and their living situation
                    does not define their inherent worth as a human being. Thus,
                    society as a whole and communities with unhoused people have
                    an obligation to alleviate the health disparities present
                    within this vulnerable community, with a focus on the issue
                    of patient non-adherence, which is closely tied to their

                    Non-adherence, a complex phenomenon, includes both
                    intentional and unintentional refusal by patients to follow
                    prescribed treatment recommendations. Intentional
                    non-adherence involves deliberate actions by patients and is
                    typically linked to their motivation levels, whereas
                    unintentional non-adherence stems from factors such as
                    limited resources or capability to adhere to medication
                    regimens.

                  <span className="AMainArticleText">
                    Adherence varies throughout patients’ treatment journeys and
                    may manifest in behaviors such as not filling prescriptions,
                    not initiating treatment, using medication incorrectly, or
                    prematurely discontinuing treatment. This multifaceted issue
                    arises from factors related to patients, treatment
                    complexity, and interactions with healthcare providers.
                    Patients may question treatment necessity, encounter
                    barriers to due complex regimens, or face communication
                    challenges with providers. A meta-analysis of 569 studies
                    found an average nonadherence rate of 25% in patients. While
                    adherence rates are highest among patients with certain
                    conditions like HIV infection or cancer, they tend to be
                    lower among those with pulmonary disease, diabetes, or sleep
                    disorders. The severity of illness often correlates with
                    adherence, with patients facing more serious conditions
                    typically adhering more closely to their prescribed
                    medication regimens.

                      Non-adherence to medication regimes among homeless
                      individuals is influenced by a myriad of factors, stemming
                      from their unique socioeconomic status and healthcare
                      challenges. One example is the absence of stable housing
                      that prioritizes basic needs such as food and shelter over
                      healthcare. This prioritization, which is sometimes
                      misconceived as negligence or non-adherence, reflects
                      individuals’ fundamental fight for survival.

                      Moreover, non-adherence to medication in homeless patients
                      is common in behavioral health treatment, with around 42%
                      of patients discontinuing their antidepressants within the
                      first month and 72% stopping after three months. Reasons
                      for this non-adherence include concerns about adverse
                      effects, forgetfulness, lack of social support,
                      insufficient knowledge, and poor communication between
                      patients and physicians. This breakdown in communication
                      can be attributed to various factors. Patients exhibit
                      diversity in education, intelligence, and language
                      proficiency, leading to potential misunderstandings. For
                      instance, explanations comprehensible to native
                      English-speaking college graduates may be entirely
                      unintelligible to those who did not complete highschool or
                      for whom English is a second language. This discrepancy
                      underscores the importance of clear and accessible
                      communication in and outside healthcare settings.

                      Moreover, the issue of health literacy further exacerbates
                      communication barriers, especially within the homeless
                      community. Research indicates that higher levels of health
                      literacy were associated with being housed and with lower
                      levels of drug use. In addition, a 2006 study conducted in
                      central North Carolina, examining medication barriers
                      among homeless women, revealed that those with low health
                      literacy faced greater challenges in administering
                      medication to their children compared to those with higher
                      health literacy. This finding underscores the dangers of
                      low health literacy, extending beyond individual
                      consequences to affect the health and well-being of family
                      members, particularly children. Finally, individuals with
                      limited health literacy frequently struggle to comprehend
                      health education materials provided by healthcare
                      professionals or pharmacists. This difficulty may extend
                      to monitoring their symptoms effectively. Also, they may
                      have concerns about developing dependency on long-term
                      medications and hold misconceptions about the efficacy of
                      medications over prolonged use. With better health
                      literacy education, knowledgeable patients could be more
                      inclined to follow through with treatments and take
                      control of their own health.

                      Furthermore, the homeless population faces additional
                      barriers contributing to non-adherence including limited
                      or no prescription insurance coverage, lack of storage
                      space for medications, limited privacy, and lack of
                      transportation to pick up their medications. More factors
                      include younger age, illicit drug use, and depression or
                      stress. These challenges underscore the complex social,
                      economic, and psychological factors affecting medication
                      adherence.
