                  Making good, effective decisions is a skill that we learn
                  throughout our lives. There are multiple factors that go into
                  choosing the best options depending on the circumstances.

                    Quick, decide: hotdogs or hamburgers? Would you rather be a
                    doctor, or a teacher? Every single day, we make decisions
                    that affect not only us, but also the people around us and
                    the environment in which we live. Sometimes, we make
                    decisions quite easily. What to eat, how to dress, or when
                    to exercise and go to sleep are all decisions we make
                    everyday that generally don’t require a lot of thought.
                    Other times, we’ll be faced with a decision that may have
                    long-lasting consequences for our lives well into the
                    future. Deciding which college to attend, for example, or
                    what job, what career, or profession to pursue tends to
                    involve more reasoning and contemplation; these kinds of
                    decisions can keep us awake at night.

                    At the most basic level, humans use their natural instincts
                    to make decisions. These are the kinds of automatic
                    behaviors we possess that are hard-wired within us. For
                    instance, we choose to drink water when we are thirsty. It’s
                    innate to make this choice, as our survival depends on it.
                    Additionally, babies naturally cry when they are hurt or
                    want something, and baby ducks know instinctively to follow
                    their mother when traveling across a body of water. In our
                    life, one&apos;s instincts can increase survival and prevent
                    dangerous situations from impacting us. Some may know this
                    as the “fight or flight” response, where we can make quick
                    decisions in order to survive. In instinct-based decisions,
                    actions always happen before any thought, and the decisions
                    are based on past experiences and are encoded in our DNA;
                    the DNA controls us, we don’t control the response.

                    Inspiration-based decision-making relates to following our
                    gut feeling, or “...our soul-driven promptings.” Such a
                    feeling inside you might be so profound that failing to
                    follow it and taking action may lead to sadness and regret.
                    This type of decision making is usually a “guidance for
                    staying in a state of flow,” rather than a “eureka” moment.
                    Perhaps, this thought will not even arise from a specific
                    experience or place. Rather, it’s a persistent idea that
                    seemingly comes from nothing. You might have to make a
                    decision about what to do in the near future, in the summer
                    for instance. On one side, you can have fun and go on a
                    vacation the entire time, doing little to no work. However,
                    your gut instinct may tell you to get a job and do some work
                    to get ahead, limiting your fun vacation time. Although you
                    might want to have fun, that gut feeling may be the deciding
                    factor: failing to follow it might lead to guilt and regret
                    about that decision later, thinking about what you missed
                    out on.

                    Logical and conscious decisions are typically very well
                    reasoned and thought out. The neocortex, a part of the
                    cerebral cortex in the brain, is our rational mind and
                    allows us to think through situations. Logical decisions
                    tend to be made over the course of some time, “between the
                    event and our response to it.” Instead of impulsive
                    decisions, thought precedes action in “determining the best
                    course of action to take in any given situation.”
                    Additionally, we have control over our actions because of
                    the deep thinking we can do with ourselves and others. For
                    instance, you might use a conscious decision on a test
                    you’re taking, deciding between two conflicting answers of A
                    and B. To make the best decision, you’ll need to use logic
                    and a process in order to come to that answer. For these
                    types of decisions, it’s important to follow a process,
                    which can be defined in seven steps in the figure below.

                  The Factor of Bias
                </span>

                    Bias, whether intentional or not, is a crucial factor in
                    many peoples’ decisions and ways of thinking. Fundamentally,
                    there are four types of bias influencing our perception of
                    certain topics. Confirmation bias involves “relying on only
                    information consistent with our preexisting beliefs while
                    ignoring information that challenges them.” For instance,
                    people may have bias in politics. If someone grows up in a
                    very political family, their relatives might influence the
                    person to think in favor of their preferred party. Since a
                    person’s parents are some of the most influential figures,
                    they might refuse to acknowledge opposing information and
                    stick with the opinion around them. Thus, confirmation bias
                    influences what policies that person may favor and cause
                    them to vote for a certain candidate, rather than looking at
                    life from a totally unbiased perspective and a completely
                    open mind to both sides. Two other types of bias include
                    outcome bias and hindsight bias. Outcome bias occurs when
                    someone is “overly focusing on the outcome and evaluating a
                    decision based on what we couldn’t have known at the time,”
                    while hindsight bias involves someone “saying ‘I knew it all
                    along’ after learning the outcome of a decision, even though
                    [they] didn’t.” Finally, people may also have bias in groups
                    when it comes to making decisions. Sometimes, people shy
                    away from saying their own opinions and agree with the group
                    in order to avoid argument or conflict, causing the group
                    decision or way of thinking to end up different than if they
                    shared their opinion.

                    Overall, our decision-making processes depend on the type of
                    environment and our past experiences. Understanding the
                    different situations in which we make decisions is important
                    to better control our thoughts and actions.
